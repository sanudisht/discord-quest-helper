**ADDITIONAL WARNINGS AND IMPORTANT NOTES:**

**1) Use alternate accounts only**  
Create and use separate alternate Discord accounts strictly for testing.  
Do not use your main account under any circumstances.  
Running this on your main account can lead to permanent bans or loss of access.

**2) Project purpose**  
This project only automates Discord quests.  
It does not perform any other actions or affect anything outside of Discord quests.  
It is not a general automation tool and should not be used for other purposes.

**3) Terms of Service and rule compliance**  
You are fully responsible for making sure your actions follow Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.  
This project may perform actions that are not allowed by Discord.  
Running it could lead to account warnings, restrictions, or permanent termination.

**4) Account safety**  
Never use your main account token or password.  
Only use tokens from disposable, alternate test accounts.  
If any token or credential is leaked, change it immediately.  
Never share your credentials or tokens with anyone.

**5) Risk of bans and suspensions**  
This code may send automated requests to Discord.  
Doing this too quickly or too often can trigger rate limits or spam detection.  
Accounts caught doing this may be permanently banned without warning.  
Use caution and test slowly in controlled environments.

**6) Privacy and data safety**  
Do not collect, store, or share information from other users.  
Do not use this to monitor or interfere with any real server or account.  
Keep all testing data local and delete logs after you are done testing.

**7) Testing environment**  
Only test this in a private or isolated environment.  
Do not run it on your main system or on servers that you care about.  
Prefer virtual machines, containers, or disposable environments for testing.

**8) Detection and automated behavior**  
Avoid any actions that resemble spam, mass messaging, or rapid activity.  
Discord systems may detect and restrict automated patterns.  
Stay within safe activity limits when testing.

**9) Responsibility disclaimer**  
I do not intend to take or use anyone’s account information.  
Any damage, bans, or data loss that occur from using this code are your responsibility.  
I am not responsible for any issues that result from running this project.

**10) Before running**  
Read Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines carefully.  
Only use a new, alternate account created for testing.  
Understand what the script does before running it.  
If you are unsure about any part, stop immediately.

**11) Important summary**
